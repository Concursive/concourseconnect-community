1.0.1 (June 2, 2009)

  Important notes:
    This release requires that the data be reindexed for search to work
    correctly.  Reindexing is done by an Admin on the View Usage page.

  Improvements:
    In documents, the currently selected folder is highlighted
    In documents, A-Z sorting now works
    Forms and tables are now displayed uniformly throughout various modules
    Removed an unintentional image that linked back to concursive in emails
    Viewing of objects was not recorded correctly, the intent is to record
      a viewing when the object has been viewed by the user, just once
    Internet Explorer (IE) display fixed in documents module
    Some wiki links failed for a Participant
    Search results are now hidden when there are none
    Blog images couldn't be uploaded
    New Tabby theme

  Developer Improvements:
    FIX: Themes can be created without a layout.jsp (the default is
      inherited, see the default theme for files and structure)
    NEW: Plug-in directory structure for services and scheduled jobs
    NEW: Added a SENSITIVE_INFORMATION mode that tells the portlet when to
      display GUEST data, PARTICIPANT data, and USER data; also adds user
      profiles in PARTICIPANT mode instead of GUEST


1.0 (May 11, 2009)
