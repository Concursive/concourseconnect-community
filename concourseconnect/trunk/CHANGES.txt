2.0 alpha (June 26, 2009)

  During alpha, features will be integrated and evaluated before having
  a final release.  This just means the features are subject to change
  and this release should be considered unstable.

  Improvements:
    Dimdim meetings can be scheduled from any listing's calendar


1.0.2 (June 23, 2009)

  Important notes:
    This release requires that the disk data be reindexed for search to
    work properly.  Reindexing is done by an Admin on the View Usage page.

  Improvements:
    Added administrative notifications for all new and/or claimed listings
    Wiki and Discussion search results now have correct HTML links
    IE7 and IE6 html improvements, particulary around hidden reviews,
      Slideshow Carousel formatting, pagination elements and wiki infobox
    When listings are created, any defined ticket/issue categories are 
      created, previously they were not attached
    Attachments in discussions couldn't be viewed or downloaded due to
      an incorrect HTML link
    When a user has been invited, but hasn't registered, choosing "forgot
      password" resends the original invitation
    Major speed improvement when browsing lots of listings (50k+)
    Listings that use international characters did not obtain a unique
      database id
    Geocoding defaults to Google when using Google Maps
    The sponsors page now shows a featured sponsor
    Improved copying and pasting web pages into the Wiki editor
    Several Business category names were truncated for new installs
    When an Admin updated a listing using the Modify Listing feature,
      the description of a listing was truncated to 255 characters
    When an Admin modified the style of a listing, the style data did
      not reload when subsequently modified

  Developer Improvements:
    NEW: Scheduler can be triggered from the workflow engine
    NEW: Workflow engine can be triggered by a named process instead of
      just by hooks
    NEW: The Abstract MVC Portlet can redirect to a specific viewer after
      the portlet action executes
    CHANGE: Improved the RunScript workflow component so that it can return
      a true/false condition
    CHANGE: Upgraded TinyMCE to 3.2.4.1


1.0.1 (June 2, 2009)

  Improvements:
    In documents, the currently selected folder is highlighted
    In documents, A-Z sorting now works
    Forms and tables are now displayed uniformly throughout various modules
    Removed an unintentional image that linked back to concursive in emails
    Viewing of objects was not recorded correctly, the intent is to record
      a viewing when the object has been viewed by the user, just once
    Internet Explorer (IE) display fixed in documents module
    Some wiki links failed for a Participant
    Search results are now hidden when there are none
    Blog images couldn't be uploaded
    New Tabby theme

  Developer Improvements:
    FIX: Themes can be created without a layout.jsp (the default is
      inherited, see the default theme for files and structure)
    NEW: Plug-in directory structure for services and scheduled jobs
    NEW: Added a SENSITIVE_INFORMATION mode that tells the portlet when to
      display GUEST data, PARTICIPANT data, and USER data; also adds user
      profiles in PARTICIPANT mode instead of GUEST
