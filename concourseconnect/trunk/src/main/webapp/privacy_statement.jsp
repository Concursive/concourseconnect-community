Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by notifying us.  Separately, customers are also asked to provide an email address when registering for the service, in order to receive a username and password.  We may also email information regarding updates to the service or company, as well as a customer newsletter.  Again, email will not be distributed or shared and customers can opt out of receiving any communication at the time it is distributed, or at the time any customer registers for the service.</p>
